# 👋 Hey there!

I'm Sameet, a third-year Information Technology student with a strong interest in data science and a growing curiosity in software and web development.

I enjoy working on projects that combine data analysis with interactive web experiences, exploring how insights can be visualized and applied to solve real-world problems.

Currently learning and experimenting with **Python** for data analysis, **JavaScript** for web development, and database management with **MySQL / Firebase / MongoDB**. Always eager to explore new technologies and apply data-driven solutions.

Open to connecting with fellow learners, developers, data enthusiasts, and anyone passionate about tech!
